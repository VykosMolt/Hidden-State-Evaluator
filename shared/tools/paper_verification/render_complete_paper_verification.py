## Executive verdict

- **Training-stage localization:** not reproduced in clean antisymmetric-linear units. Base, Thinking, and RLTT each score 0.8375 in the recovered reconstruction. Remove the 24%/95.2%/95.0% localization claim as a strong result.
- **Strict pre-answer GSM8K:** verified. ΔAUROC = +0.065790 with fresh paired task-clustered 95% CI [+0.020707, +0.112254], excluding zero.
- **Full HH evaluator swap audit:** fixed-order {m['fixed_order_accuracy']:.4f}; strict antisymmetric {m['strict_antisym_accuracy']:.4f} (95% CI [{m['strict_antisym_accuracy_ci95'][0]:.4f}, {m['strict_antisym_accuracy_ci95'][1]:.4f}]). The fixed-order result is substantially order-artifacted.
- **S3B2 matched random:** observed 5/8 = 0.625 versus native uniform-random expectation 0.3625; exact P(X≥5) = 0.0869. Above expectation, not significant at 0.05.
- **S1 and steering spot-checks:** verified exactly against source JSON/diagnostic artifacts.
- **Second powered domain:** closed as a documented preflight rejection, not silently left untested.

## 1. Why the evaluator produced the old-looking high numbers

The evaluator genuinely outputs high canonical-order accuracy, but that is not the same measurement as an antisymmetric relational probe. On the controlled 200-pair cross-backbone slice, the original attention+normalization head gives canonical accuracies 0.950 (base), 0.950 (Thinking), and 0.945 (RLTT), while strict antisymmetrized accuracies are only 0.580, 0.595, and 0.600. Swapped-direction correctness is 0.110–0.130 and the symmetric order component has mean about +1.26 to +1.29, demonstrating a strong learned preference for the first argument. Attention pooling is not required for the canonical high result, and normalization mitigates rather than creates the order dominance.

This explains how the evaluator could surface ~95% numbers: chosen was canonically placed first, and the high-capacity fixed-order head exploited that regularity. It does **not** explain or recover the historical base=24% cell. The current controlled application of the same saved head gives base=95%, and no artifact for the 24% run was found. That cell most likely depended on an unrecovered mismatch in extraction locus, preprocessing/tokenization, dataset ordering, or checkpoint/run identity; the exact cause cannot be proved without the missing artifact. The safe conclusion is that the historical cross-stage localization pattern is not reproducible, not that the evaluator never produced the logged numbers.

## 2. Fable checks

### Antisymmetric-linear localization

The original ~84.5% weights were not saved, so the closest documented probe was reconstructed: raw/NoNorm candidate differences, layer-47 loop-boundary means for L1–L4 concatenated (8192 dimensions), bias-free score `w·(h_left-h_right)`, L-BFGS logistic fit, exact swap antisymmetry. All three backbones score 0.8375 on 80 held-out ordered rows (74 source pairs), source-pair-clustered CI [0.7349, 0.9351], with swap consistency 1.0. Features are not identical: Thinking–RLTT score Pearson is 0.9989 and Base–Thinking 0.9118, but decisions are essentially unchanged.

Caveat: the reconstructed historical protocol splits positive/negative orientations at row level, so opposite orientations of a source pair can cross train/evaluation. This is a failed targeted replication, not a definitive proof of equality across stages.

### Task-clustered pre-answer CI

Raw data were recovered for 170 tasks × 4 candidates = 680 examples (407 positive, 273 negative). Five-fold task-grouped out-of-fold predictions were recreated, then 170 task IDs were sampled with replacement in each of 10,000 paired bootstrap draws, retaining all four candidates for every sampled task occurrence. No draw was skipped.

- hidden+all AUROC: 0.796973
- length+logprob AUROC: 0.731183
- ΔAUROC: +0.065790
- task-clustered 95% CI: [+0.020707, +0.112254]
- bootstrap SD: 0.023464
- leave-one-task-out Δ range: [0.056000, 0.070557]

The original code path for the historical [+0.017, +0.114] interval is not fully preserved, but the fresh task-clustered recomputation independently verifies the significance claim.

## 3. HH strict swap audit

The pinned 512-pair artifact gives fixed-order 0.9668 and strict antisymmetric 0.6367 (95% CI [0.5957, 0.6777]). The new full-test audit evaluates all 8,552 HH test pairs in both orders with local `shared/models/ouro_rltt_local`, `pairwise_epoch2.pt`, max length 768, bfloat16 backbone, float32 head, no quantization, and exact dataset indices.

- fixed-order accuracy: {m['fixed_order_accuracy']:.6f} (95% CI [{m['fixed_order_accuracy_ci95'][0]:.6f}, {m['fixed_order_accuracy_ci95'][1]:.6f}])
- swapped-direction accuracy: {m['swapped_direction_accuracy']:.6f}
- strict antisymmetric accuracy: {m['strict_antisym_accuracy']:.6f} (95% CI [{m['strict_antisym_accuracy_ci95'][0]:.6f}, {m['strict_antisym_accuracy_ci95'][1]:.6f}])
- strict sign-flip rate: {m['strict_sign_flip_rate']:.6f}
- normal/flipped score correlation: {m['normal_flipped_pearson']:.6f}
- symmetric/antisymmetric absolute-magnitude ratio: {m['symmetric_to_antisym_abs_ratio']:.6f}

The run used resume-safe inference segments recorded in JSON; all 8,552 rows are unique dataset indices. Model shard, evaluator, library, dtype, device, seed, and cache revision metadata are pinned in the full audit JSON.

## 4. Other empirical TODOs

### S3B2 native matched-random control

The eight oracle-present groups contain 10 candidates each, with positive counts 7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 8, and 2. Uniform within-group random success therefore averages 0.3625 (expected 2.9/8), not 0.625 and not the inherited S3B1 macro 0.5833. The exact heterogeneous Bernoulli tail for at least five successes is 0.0869024. Report this as above random expectation but statistically unresolved at N=8.

### S1 K-matched control

Exact artifact values: four tasks; 12 plain samples/task; temperature 0.7; top-p 0.95; 96-token sampling budget (160-token long reference). Plain-sampling oracle is 0.750, sampled-fork screen mean is 0.611 (fork minus sampling −0.139), and greedy fork produces 0 new-correct tasks. Status: `FROZEN_FORK_CLOSED__SAMPLING_EXPLAINS_SCREEN__S3_IS_LEVER`.

### Steering closure

Exactly seven methods are enumerated in the consolidation artifact. Geometry values are adapter-vs-empirical −0.0042941, adapter-vs-raw −0.0005530, raw-vs-empirical +0.1010016, and independently trained adapter convergence +0.9510944. The draft's method count and cosine are verified.

### Second powered pre-answer domain

Status: `REJECTED_AT_PREFLIGHT_BOTH_CANDIDATES`; `CROSS_DOMAIN_VERDICT = PARTIAL_NOT_FULLY_ESTABLISHED`; action `STOP_AND_DOCUMENT`. SVAMP failed strict-cut validity and parser/label checks. MATH supplied long reasoning, but parseable generations were ~21/22 correct and failures were largely truncations, making the negative class either absent or a length artifact. No full recapture was warranted.

### Historical math-transfer origin

The 47/100 and ~2.7× values remain unarchived. No raw denominator table was recovered. They may remain only as explicitly non-load-bearing historical motivation; otherwise remove the exact multiplier.

## 5. Production TODOs

- Six requested figures/tables are generated under `figures/`: pre-answer AUROC, domain-transfer matrix, CoreContent/DualAnchor roles, cache/branch schematic, S3B2 detection-vs-selection, and the two-null orthogonality audit.
- All five explicit project-relative paths in the draft resolve. Of 23 backticked artifact-file tokens, all resolve by exact/suffix search except the genuinely absent companion `changelog.md`.
- Reproducibility state is pinned to Git HEAD `{evidence['git_state']['head_at_verification']}` plus `git_status_short.txt`. No commit was created because the shared worktree has {evidence['git_state']['dirty_entry_count']} dirty entries.
- Markdown-to-LaTeX conversion is deferred: the instruction forbids modifying the draft, and v3.16 first needs the evidence patches below accepted.
